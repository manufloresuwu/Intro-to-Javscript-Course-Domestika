# Exercise 4

## What did we have to do?

In this unit (4) we had to implement the function math.random and the loops in JavaScript to have the begining of a memory card game. There is a bonus exercise in which we have to add a button and the cards will only shuffle if the user clicks that button.

## How did we solve it?
To solve this problem we implement the math.random function as the teacher explained in which we have random numbers from 1 to 99, the loops were implemented to create a div for each card so with that we would be able to actually shuffle the cards and the bonus part was kind of difficult to solve but what we did is create a button in the innerHTML then add the function .onclick and just if the user clicks the cards will shuffle and show on the screen.
