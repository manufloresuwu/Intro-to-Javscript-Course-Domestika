# Exercise 5

## What did we have to do?
In this exercise we had to learn how to add a value to the attribute 'tarjetas' (cards in English) to make them know if they match or not, in case they do we have an animation that removes the cards 1000ms after the user clicks on them and in case they do not there is another animation that just shakes the cards and put them back in their places. the bonus is make a counter that tells you how many attempts, mistakes and matches you did.

## How did we solve it?
First we add two functions that they add a class list to our arrays of cards so we know if they are matches or mistakes, for the bonus what we did is add counters to this functions but instead of +1 we used a +0.5 since we add the feature to two cards and not just one.
